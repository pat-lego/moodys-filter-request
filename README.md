# Sample AEM project template

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* core: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* ui.config: contains runmode specific OSGi configs for the project
* all: a single content package that embeds all of the compiled modules (bundles and content packages) including any vendor dependencies

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.config`)

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

### Unit tests

This show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To
test, execute:

    mvn clean test

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:
